# TicTacToe
A simple console game for two players written in Python.

# Tools:
Python, Figlet

# Figlet
The figlet command can be used to draw large sized text banners. I used it to print out the header of the game so if you do not have it install yet (and want to see the game with all it's aspects), you can install it through teminal using (Ubuntu): 

    sudo apt-get install figlet

Then make sure to make header.sh file executable before you execute the game.

    chmod a+x header.sh
